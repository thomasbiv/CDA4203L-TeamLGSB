Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    18 out of   6,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        16 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           52
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            18 out of      52   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   8 out of      52   15%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              14 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
